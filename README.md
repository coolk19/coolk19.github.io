# Khalid Talakshi's Portfolio
Hi, my name is Khalid Talakshi, and this is the website for my online portfolio, and my main github repository. Thanks for stopping by!

## A little bit about me
I am a recent IB Dipoloma Programme Graduate, as well as a High School Graduate. I love programming, mainly web design, app design, and game design. I also have interests in Business and Politics, being the President of my local DECA Chapter, a DECA ICDC competitor, the Secretary General of our Model UN Chapter, and a member of our City Council's Committee for Model UN. I have always believed in technology for good, and how we can use computer science and gaming to help improve the world. At the end of the day, technology is a tool to help make people's lives easier and better, and it is the job of programmers and designers to create the tools to do so. 

## Current Projects
I have some current projects that I like to keep working on over time, because every project should be a work in progress. 

### Simple Finance 
One major problem in our education system is a lack of awareness for personal financial literacy. The responsability falls typically on the parents of children, which can be a major issue if there is a lack of financial literacy from the parents or a lack of awarness for teaching children this. Simple finance aims to teach children the basics of money management skills through gamified concepts, as well as help engage both parents and children in a conversation about financial literacy. Using simple functions and interfaces combined with educational activities, children should be able to become financially independent in the real world. 

The current state of the project is currently in early development. Right now we are trying to figure the best system to use for the app. Our current plan is to have a web version of the app deployed by the end of the year, with a native mobile version to begin in early 2019. If you are interested in helping with this project, please feel free to contact me through my website.
